## CI pipeline

Integrating automated tests in the heart of the CI build pipeline, as early in development lifecycle as possible, means detecting errors as early as possible, reducing risk of finding issues in production.

## Aspire to automation

Automation-first approach helps keep test automation in-parallel with feature development, which enables test teams to achieve in-sprint automation.

This doesn't mean everything MUST be automated, but to keep testing relevant and useful, all tests should be considered.
