## The development lifecyle

Quality is not an isolated part of a project, it is central, and as testers will be working with as a developer, it's imperative there is understanding of the process.

The input into the pipeline is requirements, and as much effort should be put into Definition of Ready, as Definitions of Done.

## CI pipeline

Integrating automated tests in the heart of the CI build pipeline, as early in development lifecycle as possible, means detecting errors as early as possible, reducing risk of finding issues in production.

These tests are not limited to UI and API, performance tests should be considered early, not as last minute consideration.

## Aspire to automation

Automation-first approach helps keep test automation in-parallel with feature development, which enables test teams to achieve in-sprint automation.

This doesn't mean everything MUST be automated, but to keep testing relevant and useful, all tests should be considered.
