Traditionally one of the more boring project documents, and it shouldn't be as it can be reference point for the team.

## The team way of working

It's not only code that follows the pipeline, the whole team does.

Yes, there is a human side to test strategies - the team's way of working, and aspiring to transparency will make this easier.

## The project lifecyle

Quality is not an isolated part of a project, it is central, so understanding of ways of working is imperative.

If an approach (BDD, for example) is being followed, then you will need clarification to what extent it's being followed.

## CI/CD pipeline

Integrating automated tests in the heart of the CI/CD build pipeline, means finding issues earlier in development lifecycle.

These tests are not limited to UI and API, performance tests should be considered early, not as last minute consideration.

## Aspire to automation

Automation-first approach helps keep test automation in-parallel with feature development, which enables test teams to achieve in-sprint automation.

This doesn't mean everything MUST be automated, but to keep testing relevant and useful, all tests should be considered.
