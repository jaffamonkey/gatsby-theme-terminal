## The project lifecyle

Quality is not an isolated part of a project, it is central, so understanding of ways of working is imperative.

If an approach (BDD, for example) is being followed, then you will need clarification to what extent it's being followed.

The input into the pipeline is requirements, and as much effort should be put into Definition of Ready, as Definitions of Done.

## CI/CD pipeline

Integrating automated tests in the heart of the CI/CD build pipeline, as early in development lifecycle as possible, means detecting errors as early as possible, reducing risk of finding issues in production.

These tests are not limited to UI and API, performance tests should be considered early, not as last minute consideration.

## Aspire to automation

Automation-first approach helps keep test automation in-parallel with feature development, which enables test teams to achieve in-sprint automation.

This doesn't mean everything MUST be automated, but to keep testing relevant and useful, all tests should be considered.

## The team way of working

<Message variant='muted' mb={4}>
  Focus on a transparent and supportive work culture will pay dividends
</Message>

Yes, there is a human side to test strategies - the team's way of working, and key to success is transparency across the board. 

Business will end up with confidence they have the whole picture, and the team will work more effectively, not having to worry about "playing the game".
