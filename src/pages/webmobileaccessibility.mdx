# Accessibility audits

A lot can be done to mitigate Accessibility errors, by investing time at design phase and integrating checks in the CI pipeline.

Tools will go part-way at least, but full verification will entail manual checking.

# `WCAG`

> Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. 

<Text as="p">Web Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1) <Link href='https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/'>https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/</Link></Text>

Both [Apple](https://www.apple.com/uk/accessibility/vision) and [Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility) is very proactive with tools and development standards of their own, based on w3 web app Accessbility standards, but with additional attention to mobile-specific challenges.

A first important step is to realise Acessibility is an evolving improvements exercise.  

Just because your app passes in Sprint 5, it doesn't mean it will pass in Sprint 7. 

So treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibilit checks earlier in the development lifecycle.

From the initial accessibility statement the audit provides, it can be kept updated, as your app progresses and improves.
