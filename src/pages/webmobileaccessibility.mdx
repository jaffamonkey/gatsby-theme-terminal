## Continual improvement

A first important step is to realise Acessibility is a continual improvements exercise - just because your app passes in Sprint 5, it doesn't mean it will pass in Sprint 7. 

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.

## Accessibility in the pipeline

Mitigate Accessibility errors, by investing time checking at design phase - you can add lean tools to you CI pipeline to verify code super-fast!

Tools will go part-way at least, but full verification will entail manual checking.
