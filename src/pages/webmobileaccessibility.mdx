## Accessibility audits

A lot can be done to mitigate Accessibility errors, by investing time at design phase and integrating checks in the CI pipeline.

Tools will go part-way at least, but full verification will entail manual checking.

## Tools

A first important step is to realise Acessibility is a continual improvements exercise - just because your app passes in Sprint 5, it doesn't mean it will pass in Sprint 7. 

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
