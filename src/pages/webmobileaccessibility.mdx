<Message variant='secondary' mb={2}>If you have a mobile or web app, where Accessibility is key, an audit is prudent at key stages in the development cycle.</Message>

Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. 

In addition to providing audits for Web App Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1),Mobile App Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.0), I can also advise on (and implement) quality checks in your project pipeline.  From design to code, there is a lot you can do to prevent finding many errors in production.

### Audit output

- Full reports
- Annotated error screenshots
- Video recordings (for screen reader testing)
- Tools used for testing
- Process improvements suggestions

Embedding accessibility tests in your CI pipeline - you can add lean tools to verify code super-fast!

## Tools

A first important step is to realise Acessibility is a continual improvements exercise.

Just because your app passes in Sprint 5, it doesn't mean it will pass in Sprint 8. 

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
