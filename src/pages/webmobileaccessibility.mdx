# Accessibility audits

A lot can be done to mitigate Accessibility errors, by investing time at design phase and integrating checks in the CI pipeline.

Tools will go part-way at least, but full verification will entail manual checking.

Treat an audit as a startpoint, to integrating accessibility checks earlier in the development lifecycle.
