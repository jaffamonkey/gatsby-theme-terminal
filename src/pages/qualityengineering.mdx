## Do a test strategy

<Message variant='secondary' mb={4}>Test strategies cross over into requirements, design, devops and development - and they should!</Message>

It's not fixed in stone, a <Link href="https://condescending-jepsen-e639a6.netlify.app/teststrategy/">test strategy</Link> identifies ways of working, current tech stack information and also aspirations for improvements.

Done well, i.e. with brevity, clarity and relevance, the strategy will become a go-to for everyone on projects or connected to it.

## Shift left to UXD

<Message variant='secondary' mb={4}>Implement quality checks earlier in development cycle, including design and requirements stages</Message>

UX team can (and probably) design against accessibility standards and design principles, so don't omit inviting them to Sprint planning or simply to chat about a feature. 

UX teams are woefully underused, yet so wel-versed in user stories, they seem natural choice to drive planning sessions.

## Less is more

<Message variant='success' mb={4}>Tests belong in the CI/CD pipelines</Message>

Sometimes investing is a feature-rich test framework is a good idea, but starting small is always the best place to start - tests run as part of CI/CD should be as lean (fast) as possible.

onversely, don’t waste too much time on native coding - packages are there too help you, just be selective and conscious of potential overheads created on the build pipeline server.

## Start non-functional tests early

<Message variant='primary' mb={4}>
  Non-functional tests provide useful feesback from code changes
</Message>

Ask any developer and they will tell you how useful performance tests are.

You can  waste a lot of time focusing on trapping functional errors, but these hold little value in compisron to testing for performance issues.

You don’t need to run a heavy load test to get useful feedback. Security testing is an essential not an option, and investing in code analysis tool will help maintain  performance.

## The team

<Message variant='muted' mb={4}>
  Focus on a transparent and supportive work culture will pay dividends
</Message>

Yes, there is a human side to quality engineering - the team, and key to success is transparency across the board. 

Business will end up with confidence they have the whole picture, and the team will work more effectively, not having to worry about "playing the game".
