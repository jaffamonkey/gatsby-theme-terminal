Quality at all stages in project pipeline needs regular reivew; and mostly importantly, the team should feel they can work with autonomy.  This is part of Quality engineering, it's not just about the technical solutions. Quality Engineering concerns all stages in project pipeline, and ways of working.

## Bring transparency

With experience, comes the confidence to be transparent - but many choose not to be, out of irrational fear. It's important to be truthful about project progress - it's not necessary to be datailed on every single issue (you have to take audience into consideration), but creating atmosphere of trust pays dividends.

## Do a test strategy

It's not fixed in stone, a <Link href="https://condescending-jepsen-e639a6.netlify.app/teststrategy/">test strategy</Link> identifies ways of working, current tech stack information, aspirations for improvements.

If maintained well, it will become a go-to for everyone on a project. And reusable for other projects too!

## Shift left to UXD

UX team can (and probably) design against accessibility standards and design principles, so don't omit inviting them to Sprint planning or simply to chat about a feature. 

UX teams are woefully underused, yet so well-versed in user stories, they seem natural choice to drive planning sessions.

## Less is more

Sometimes investing is a feature-rich test framework is a good idea, but starting small is always the best place to start - tests run as part of CI/CD should be as lean (fast) as possible.

But don’t waste too much time on native coding - packages are there too help you, just be selective and conscious of both potential overheads created on the build pipeline and additional package dependencies introduced.

## Start non-functional tests early

You can  waste a lot of time focusing on trapping functional errors, but these hold little value in comparisron to testing for performance issues.

You don’t need to run a heavy load test to get useful feedback, and developers find these tests useful.
