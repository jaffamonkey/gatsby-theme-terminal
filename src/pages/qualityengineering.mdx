## Do a test strategy

It's not fixed in stone, a <Link href="https://condescending-jepsen-e639a6.netlify.app/teststrategy/">test strategy</Link> identifies ways of working, current tech stack information, aspirations for improvements.

If maintained well, it will become a go-to for everyone on a project. And reusable for other projects too!

## Shift left to UXD

UX team can (and probably) design against accessibility standards and design principles, so don't omit inviting them to Sprint planning or simply to chat about a feature. 

UX teams are woefully underused, yet so well-versed in user stories, they seem natural choice to drive planning sessions.

## Less is more

Sometimes investing is a feature-rich test framework is a good idea, but starting small is always the best place to start - tests run as part of CI/CD should be as lean (fast) as possible.

But don’t waste too much time on native coding - packages are there too help you, just be selective and conscious of both potential overheads created on the build pipeline and additional package dependencies introduced.

## Start non-functional tests early

Ask any developer and they will tell you how useful performance tests are.

You can  waste a lot of time focusing on trapping functional errors, but these hold little value in compisron to testing for performance issues.

You don’t need to run a heavy load test to get useful feedback. Security testing is an essential not an option, and investing in code analysis tool will help maintain  performance.
