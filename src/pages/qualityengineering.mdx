Quality engineering is not just about the technical solutions. Quality Engineering concerns all stages in project pipeline, and ways of working.

So, what I can bring to your project  ....

## Transparency

With experience, comes the confidence to be transparent - but many choose not to be, out of irrational fear. It's important to be truthful about project progress - it's not necessary to be datailed on every single issue (you have to take audience into consideration), but creating atmosphere of trust pays dividends.

## Effective test strategy

It's not fixed in stone, a test strategy identifies ways of working, current tech stack information, and aspirations for improvements. If maintained well, it will become a go-to for everyone on a project. And reusable for other projects too!

## Help team shift left

UX team can (and probably) design against accessibility standards and design principles, so don't omit inviting them to Sprint planning or simply to chat about a feature. UX teams are woefully underused, yet so well-versed in user stories, they seem natural choice to drive planning sessions.

## A `less is more` approach

Sometimes investing is a feature-rich test framework is a good idea, but starting small is always the best place to start - tests run as part of CI/CD should be as lean (fast) as possible. But don’t waste too much time on native coding - packages are there too help you, just be selective and conscious of both potential overheads.

## Starting non-functional tests earlier

You can  waste a lot of time focusing on trapping functional errors, but these hold little value in comparisron to testing for performance issues. You don’t need to run a heavy load test to get useful feedback, and developers find these tests useful.
