Quality engineering is not just about the technical solutions. Quality Engineering concerns all stages in project pipeline, and ways of working.

## Transparency

With experience, comes the confidence to be transparent - but many choose not to be, out of irrational fear. It's important to be truthful about project progress - it's not necessary to be datailed on every single issue (you have to take audience into consideration), but creating atmosphere of trust pays dividends.

## Effective test strategy

It's not fixed in stone, a test strategy identifies ways of working, current tech stack information, and aspirations for improvements. If maintained well, it will become a go-to for everyone on a project. And reusable for other projects too!

## Help team shift left

Shifting left with mean putting quality first at all stage in the development cycle, starting at requirements and design stages. This maintain quality of the input for developers, and less issues to find further down the CI/CD pipelines.  UX teams are woefully underused, yet so well-versed in user stories AND the designs, they seem natural choice to drive planning sessions. This can help keep shift-left mentality, on track.

## A `less is more` approach

Sometimes investing is a feature-rich test framework is a good idea, but starting small is always the best place to start - tests run as part of CI/CD should be as lean (fast) as possible. But don’t waste too much time on native coding - packages are there too help you, just be selective and conscious of both potential overheads.

## Starting non-functional tests earlier

You can  waste a lot of time focusing on trapping functional errors, but these hold little value in comparisron to testing for performance issues. You don’t need to run a heavy load test to get useful feedback, and developers find these tests useful.
