# Quality Engineering

## Shift left to UXD
UX team can (and probably) design against accessibility standards and design principles, so don't omit inviting them to Sprint planning or simply to chat about a feature. UX teams are woefully underused, yet so wel-versed in user stories, they seem natural choice to drive planning sessions.

## Less is more
Sometimes investing is a feature-rich test framework is a good idea, but starting small is always the best place to start. Tests run as part of CI/CD should be as lean (fast) as possible. Conversely, don’t waste too much time on native coding - packages are there too help you, just be selective and conscious of potential overheads created on the build pipeline server.

## Start non-functional tests early
You don’t need to run a heavy load test to get useful feedback. Security testing is an essential not an option, and investing in code analysis tool will help maintain  performance.

  Focus on a transparent and supportive work culture will pay dividends

## The team
Yes, there is a human side to quality engineering - the team, and key to success is transparency across the board. Business will end up with confidence they have the whole picture, and the team will work more effectively, not having to worry about "playing the game". Team building games are patching over problems, and not as inclusive an exercise as you might imagine.
