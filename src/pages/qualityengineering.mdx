<Message variant='secondary' mb={2}>Shift left to testing earlier in the development cycle</Message>
[Shift left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift-left_testing) is about implementing quality checks earlier in development cycle, even as far as Design and Business Analaysis. Shift left in testing marked point where testing met quality assurance, which is concerned around ways of working. Checks implemented earlier in development cycle, will avoid error further down the CI/CD pipelines.

## `Shift left to design checks`
UX team can design against accessibility standards and design principles

## `Shift left to business requirements`
Adopting a specification by example approach (BDD-inpsired), breaking down user stories into testable scenarios start “the conversation”, and testing involvement These conversations lead to a more unified understanding of the user story, by working out examples which become testable scenarios. We then have a mechanism to test and also indicate progress of feature development (passing vs failing scenarion tests).

<Alert variant='success' mb={2}>
Test engineering involves building test framework(s) to engineer functional and non-functional tests, destined for CI/CD pipelines.</Alert>

## `Less is more`
Sometimes investing is a feature-rich test framework is a good idea, but starting small is always the best place to start. Tests run as part of CI/CD should be as lean (fast) as possible. Conversely, don’t waste too much time on native coding - packages are there too help you, just be selective and conscious of potential overheads created on the build pipeline server.

## `Start non-functional tests early`
You don’t need to run a heavy load test to get useful feedback. Security testing is an essential not an option, and investing in code analysis tool will help maintain  performance.

## `The team`
Yes, there is a human side to quality engineering - the team, and key to success is transparency across the board. Business will end up with confidence they have the whole picture, and the team will work more effectively, not having to worry about "playing the game". Team building games are patching over problems, and not as inclusive an exercise as you might imagine.

  Focus on a transparent and supportive work culture will pay dividends
